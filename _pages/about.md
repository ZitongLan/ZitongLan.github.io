I am a senior student majoring in Electrical Engineering at [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/). I am looking for Phd position at wireless sensing and communication, ubiquitous computing and HCI. I am now a research assistant at [ISCAS](http://english.is.cas.cn/) advised by [Prof. Jie Xiong](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~jxiong/) and [Prof. Fusang Zhang](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~zhangfusang?language=en) in wireless sensing system implementation and evaluation. I have also been working with [Prof. Tengxiang Zhang](https://txzhang.info/) at [ICT](http://www.ict.ac.cn/) in the exploration of combining IoT devices and User-end sources to facilitate ubiquitous computing for HCI system.
