I am an incoming PhD student at ESE department of [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/) under the supervision of professor [Mingmin Zhao](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mingminz/). My research interests are wireless sensing, mobile and ubiquitous computing. I graduated from [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/) with a bachelor degree in Electrical Engineering with honor. 

I have worked with [Jie Xiong](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~jxiong/) and [Fusang Zhang](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~zhangfusang?language=en) in wireless sensing system implementation and evaluation. In the past, I worked on a project about realizing intermittent computing on Arduino with [Yang Zhang](https://yangzhang.dev/). I have also worked with [Tengxiang Zhang](https://txzhang.info/) to build a novel interaction system of using BLE direction findings to help users select IoT devices.
