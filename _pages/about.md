I am a senior student majoring in Electrical Engineering at [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/). I am looking for Phd position at mobile and ubiquitous computing, wireless sensing and communication, and HCI. I am now a research assistant at [ISCAS](http://english.is.cas.cn/) advised by [Prof. Jie Xiong](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~jxiong/) and [Prof. Fusang Zhang](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~zhangfusang?language=en) in wireless sensing system implementation and evaluation. I have also worked with [Prof. Tengxiang Zhang](https://txzhang.info/) in the exploration of using IoT devices information to facilitate ubiquitous computing and HCI applications.
