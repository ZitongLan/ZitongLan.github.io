I am a senior student majoring in Electrical Engineering at [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/). I have a wide span of research interests in mobile and ubiquitous computing, wireless system and networking, and HCI. 

I am now a remote research intern at [Umass Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/) advised by [Prof. Jie Xiong](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~jxiong/) and [Prof. Fusang Zhang](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~zhangfusang?language=en) in wireless sensing system implementation and evaluation.I am also now working on intermittent computing of Arduino with [Prof. Yang Zhang](https://yangzhang.dev/). I have also worked with [Prof. Tengxiang Zhang](https://txzhang.info/) in the exploration of using spatial information of BLE devices to facilitate device selection.
